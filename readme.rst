This is the source code for the *Clear Communication* website.
This website provides documentation for the *Clear Communication* project,
and a home for the personal blogs of our contributors.
It also serves as a test-bed for new technologies that support the aims of the community.
We specialize in computer-based technologies but do not ignore others.

This is a work in progress and is not really ready for prime-time. It shows up early, publically,
as a result of the tools we are using and because we hope that others will help us define what the
project should be doing. Our policy is that people should be able to see how things are being created
and developed.
