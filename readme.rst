This is the source code for  the Clear Communication website.
This website provides documentation for the Clear Communication project,
a home for personal blogs of our contributors,
and serves as a test-bed for new technologies that support the aims of the community.
This is a work in progress and it is not really ready for prime-time. It shows up
early as a result dt the tools we are using.
