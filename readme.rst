This is the source code for  the *Clear Communication* website.
This website provides documentation for the *Clear Communication* project,
and a home for the personal blogs of our contributors.
It also serves as a test-bed for new technologies that support the aims of the community.
We specialize in computer-based technologies but do not ignore others.

This is a work in progress and is not really ready for prime-time. It shows up early, publically,
as a result of the tools we are using and because w hope that others will help us define what the
project should be doing.
