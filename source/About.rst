About the *Clear Communication* organization
############################################

*Clear Communication* is a group of people who are interested in
exploring new ways of communicating with each other in the broadest sense
of communicate, not just through verbal communication. We hope that
better communication may help the existence and thriving of all sorts of
communities.
It intends to concentrate on the use of modern technology to help improve
communication between people and groups.
